##1.Introduction:
Task to create a strong password, evaluate its strength, and understand password security.

##2.Password creation process:
I created a password that is 13 characters long, mix letter contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. 
I avoided using common words or personal information”.

##3.Passwords:
My passwords: 1. Eh$1kpsu!5TA3
              2.Ka#kp3hg%i1$A
              3.abcd1234
##4.Evaluate and Record Results:
 #1.Password: Eh$1kpsu!5TA3

  Time to Crack: 422 million years
My password is very strong because it contains 13 characters            and also have lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers. 
My password could not contain common password like names and common sequence. 
  Improvement: NO improvement needed.

##Brute Force Attack:

In a brute force attack, an attacker uses trial and error to guess a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found.

These attacks can be performed quickly by computers and are most effective against short or simple passwords.

Automated tools are often used to accelerate the process. The fewer the characters and the less complex the password, the faster it is to crack.

##Dictionary Attack:

This method leverages a precompiled list (“dictionary”) of common words, phrases, or previously leaked passwords.

Attackers systematically enter each word from the list, targeting the tendency of users to pick simple, common, or easy-to-remember passwords.

Dictionary attacks are faster than brute force attacks because they focus only on the most likely options rather than every possible combination.

                                                           ###How Password Complexity Affects Security

Stronger Defense: Complex passwords are much harder to guess or crack because they use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, increasing the total number of possible combinations.

Longer Crack Times: As length and complexity increase, both brute force and dictionary attacks require exponentially more time and computing power, often making attacks impractical.

Less Predictable: Complex passwords that avoid common words, patterns, and personal information are less likely to appear in attackers’ dictionaries, making dictionary attacks far less effective.

Higher Entropy: Complexity increases entropy (unpredictability), reducing the chances of successful password guessing.

                                                                       ###answer interview questions


### 1. What makes a password strong?

A strong password is long (usually 12+ characters), unpredictable, and uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It does not contain easily guessed words, patterns, or personal information.


### 2. Why are passwords important?

Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to personal accounts and sensitive data. They protect your identity, personal information, and organizational resources from cybercriminals.


### 3. What is a dictionary attack?

A dictionary attack is a method used by attackers to crack passwords by systematically entering every word in a pre-defined list (like a dictionary), hoping one matches the user's password. Simple and common passwords are especially vulnerable to this attack.


### 4. What is a brute force attack?

A brute force attack involves trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. The longer and more complex a password, the harder it is to crack using this method.


### 5. How to store passwords safely?

- Use a reputable password manager to securely generate and store passwords.
- Never write passwords on paper or save them in plain text files.
- Avoid reusing passwords across different sites.
Password managers encrypt your password vault, making them much safer than manual storage.


### 6. Why use a password manager?

Password managers generate, remember, and autofill complex passwords for different accounts. This reduces the temptation to reuse or simplify passwords, making accounts more resistant to attacks.


### 7. What is two-factor authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two forms of identity verification (for example, a password plus a code sent to your phone). It adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to gain access even if they learn your password.


### 8. Why should passwords be regularly changed?

Regularly changing passwords limits the window of opportunity for an attacker who may have obtained an old password. It’s especially important if a service/data breach is suspected.


### 9. What are the security implications of password creation?

Weak or reused passwords make accounts vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, and data breaches. Strong, unique passwords for each account limit risk and expand overall digital security
